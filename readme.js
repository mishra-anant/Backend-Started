/* NODE. js is a javascript runtime built on Google's open-source V8 javascript engine*/

/* Node js is just another javascript runtime.It's just like a container like an environment 
in which a program written in javascript can be executed but outside of any browser */

/* Who actually does execute the code if not the browser and thats where v8  engine developed
by google comes into play.Thhats exactly where javascript course will be parsed and run in
NODEJS. */

/* JAVASCRIPT ON THE SERVER! 
Now we have the javascript outside of the browser in a kind of stand alone environment with NODE.JS
we can do many different things with javascript that were completely impossible before 
1)accessing the file system
2)better networking capabilities with Node.js
and all these factors together gives us a perfect condition  to use NODE.JS as a web server meaning 
that we can finally use javascript on the server-side of web development in order to build
FAST,HIGHLY SCALABLE NETWORK APPLICATIONS(BACK-END) for powering the backend.
*/

/* use cases for NODE.JS and why do we use it 
1)Node.js applications are so fast and so scalable because NODE.js is single-threded,based
on event driven ,non-blocking I?O model which makes node.js very light weight and efficient.

2)Perfect for building fast and scalable data intensive apps.

This makes node.js a perfect fit for building a perfect fit for building all different kinds 
of applications like:-
1)API with database behindit(preferably NOSQQL)
2)Data streaming(Think Youtube)(Netflix)
3)Real-time chat applications
4)Server side web applications where the entire content is simply generated right on the server.
 */

/* APPS THAT WE SHOULD NOT BUILD WITH NODE.JS 
1)Applications with heavy server side processing(cpu- intensive) like heavy image manipulation
,video conversions ,files compression etc.
*/

//Another great reason for using node is hat there is a huge library of open source packages or modules available everyone
//for free.Its called NPM.

/* Huge active community */

//underscore _ saves the previous result

/* with node js we can do all kinds of amazing things tht we canot do with javascript in the browser for eg 
reading files with javascript in the browser from the file system */

/* In order to do that we need to use a node module.So nodejs is really built around this concept
of modules where all kinds of additional functionality are stored in a module.And in the case for reading files
inside the fs module */

/*How to open up these modules and how to use them ? :- we use require in our code */
